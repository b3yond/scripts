# Wouldn't this be a hell of a story "That time I used a russian roulette

# Don't forget to be root!!!

# Did you know that Malcolm X claims that once, in order to show he wasn't
#  afraid to die, he played russian roulette, pulling the trigger 3 times
#  in a row. He later said in the autobiography where he says this, that he
#  had actually palmed the round. Maybe this can be inspiration?
